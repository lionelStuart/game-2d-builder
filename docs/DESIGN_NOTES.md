# 🧱 Core Design Notes

## 🎯 Vision
A cozy, low-stress 2D world where players gather resources, craft tools, and build functional & aesthetic structures — no combat, no timers, just flow and satisfaction.

## 🧩 Key Systems (Draft)
- **Resource Loop**: Wood → Planks → Walls; Stone → Bricks → Foundations
- **Building Grid**: Snap-to-grid placement with rotation & preview
- **Structure States**: Draft → Building → Complete → Upgradable
- **Visual Feedback**: Particle effects on placement, smooth animations

## 🌟 First MVP Goal
Place a single wooden hut (3x3) that appears in-world with shadow & collision.
